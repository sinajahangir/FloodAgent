Coupled with a **Low** population density and an expected **Local** road class, the overall flood exposure is assessed as **Moderate**.\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "2.  **Consider the SoVI Class (Low):** This is a significant positive factor for resilience. A \"Low\" SoVI class implies that the community likely possesses stronger social cohesion, better access to resources, and potentially higher levels of preparedness and social capital. This inherent strength can help individuals and the community cope with and recover from a flood event.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Factor in Population Density (Low):** A \"Low\" population density is generally beneficial for resilience. Fewer people in the affected area can mean less widespread damage to homes and infrastructure, and potentially easier evacuation and access for emergency services. It also suggests that individual households might have more space or resources to manage their own immediate response.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Analyze the Road Class (Local):** An expected \"Local\" road class suggests that while the immediate access to the flood pixel might be via local roads, the broader transportation network is likely more robust. This could mean that essential services can still reach the area, and evacuation routes might exist through larger arteries, even if the very closest routes are affected.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Synthesize the Factors:**\n",
            "    *   The \"Moderate\" flood exposure is mitigated by the positive indicators.\n",
            "    *   The \"Low\" SoVI class strongly suggests a community with a good capacity to respond and recover due to social strengths.\n",
            "    *   \"Low\" population density reduces the scale of potential impact and can facilitate easier response.\n",
            "    *   While \"Local\" roads might be affected, it doesn't automatically imply complete isolation, especially when considered alongside the other factors.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Conclude on Resilience:** The combination of a community that is likely well-connected and resourceful (Low SoVI) with a less concentrated population and generally manageable access routes, even in the face of a moderate flood exposure, points towards a **Moderate to High** level of flood resilience. The community is likely better equipped to withstand and recover from an event of this nature compared to areas with higher social vulnerability, higher population density, or critical infrastructure reliance on only heavily impacted road types.\n"
