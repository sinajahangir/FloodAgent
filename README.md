# FloodAgent
An intelligent system that leverages machine learning, LLM, and geospatial data to evaluate flood risk in vulnerable regions (case study: Calgary). This agent integrates flood simulation, social vulnerability, and census data to provide predictive insights and support disaster preparedness and response planning.


The repo is specifically designed to run the agent in the Colab environment. If you want to run the code locally on your machine, you need to adjust the syntax in the setup file and also the Python notebook.

# Setup and running
Check the Google Colab demo file.

# Data
Sample necessary data for running the Colab notebook code is provided in the Data folder

# GUI
This version of the Flood Proximity Agent includes an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) built with ipywidgets for use in Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks. The interface provides a clean, chat-style environment where users can enter natural-language queries about flood risk or proximity at specific geographic coordinates. The agent processes each query through its underlying geospatial analysis engine and responds with clear, formatted answers directly in the chat window.
