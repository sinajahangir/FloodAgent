# FloodAgent
An intelligent system that leverages machine learning, LLM, and geospatial data to evaluate flood risk in vulnerable regions (case study: Calgary). This agent integrates flood simulation, social vulnerability, and census data to provide predictive insights and support disaster preparedness and response planning.


The repo is specifically designed to run the agent in the Colab environment. If you want to run the code locally on your machine, you need to adjust the syntax in the setup file and also the Python notebook.

# Setup and running
Check the Google Colab demo file.

# Data
Sample necessary data for running the Colab notebook code is provided in the Data folder
