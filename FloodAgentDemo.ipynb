            "My estimation of \"Good\" flood resilience is based on the interplay of the provided data points, particularly focusing on the indicators of vulnerability and the characteristics of the flood event. Here's how I arrived at that conclusion:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **SoVI Value Class (Low):** This is a primary indicator of social vulnerability. A \"Low\" SoVI value suggests that the community in this area has fewer social characteristics that would make them more susceptible to the impacts of a flood. This could include factors like lower income, less elderly population, fewer single-parent households, etc. **This directly contributes to higher resilience.**\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Population Density (Low):** Low population density means that in the event of a flood, there are fewer people directly exposed and potentially impacted. This makes evacuation and rescue efforts generally more manageable and reduces the overall scale of the social disruption. **This also contributes to higher resilience.**\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Distance to Flood Pixel (107.27 meters):** While there is a recorded flood event nearby, the distance of 107 meters is not exceedingly close. This suggests that while flooding is a known issue in the vicinity, the immediate area might not be subject to the most severe inundation, or that the floodwaters might not reach this specific point with the same intensity. **This provides a moderate level of confidence, leaning towards resilience as the flood isn't at your doorstep.**\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Expected Road Class (Local):** Local roads are typically less critical infrastructure for large-scale evacuation or emergency response compared to arterial roads. However, in a low population density area, the impact of a local road being flooded might be less disruptive to the overall community. **This is a neutral to slightly negative factor, but its impact is mitigated by other factors.**\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Flood Exposure Class (Moderate):** This is an important intermediate assessment. \"Moderate\" exposure suggests that the location is subject to flooding, but not to the extreme degree that might overwhelm immediate coping mechanisms. It acknowledges the risk without classifying it as critically high. **This is a moderate input, not definitively high or low resilience.**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Synthesis for Resilience:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The key to the \"Good\" resilience estimation lies in the strong indicators of **low social vulnerability (Low SoVI)** and **low population density**. Even with a \"Moderate\" flood exposure and the proximity of a flood event, the underlying social fabric and the number of people directly affected are likely to be less impacted. This means that the community has a stronger capacity to withstand, respond to, and recover from the flood event. The distance of the flood pixel and the local road class are considered, but they do not override the positive social and demographic indicators that point towards a more resilient community.\n"
