This suggests that the community in the vicinity of the flood data point has a lower susceptibility to the social impacts of flooding due to factors like income, age, or housing type. Lower social vulnerability generally means a greater capacity to cope and recover.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Population Density:** A **Moderate** population density indicates that while there are people present, it's not an overwhelmingly dense area.

            "\n",
            "3.  **Flood Exposure:** The **Moderate** flood exposure, derived from the population density and road class, signifies that there is a tangible risk of flooding, but it's not extreme. The presence of local roads suggests that while there's connectivity, these are typically less robust than major highways, which can be a factor during severe flooding events.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Distance to Flood Pixel:** The **237-meter distance** is relatively close. This means the recorded flood event is a relevant indicator of potential risk for your location. It's close enough to be a strong consideration for resilience planning.\n",
